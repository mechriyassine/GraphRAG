# GraphRAG System

A personal exploration into advanced document analysis and knowledge extraction using Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a personal research project that combines cutting-edge AI technologies to create an intelligent document analysis system. The project demonstrates how modern NLP techniques can be integrated to build sophisticated knowledge extraction and question-answering capabilities.

## üß† Core Concept

Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems rely primarily on vector similarity search. This project extends that concept by introducing a **graph-based approach** that captures relationships between entities, creating a more nuanced understanding of document content.

### The GraphRAG Advantage

- **Semantic Understanding**: Goes beyond keyword matching to understand contextual relationships
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Builds interconnected knowledge graphs from unstructured text
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines vector search with graph traversal for richer context
- **Entity Relationship Mapping**: Automatically identifies and maps relationships between people, concepts, and organizations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system integrates multiple AI technologies in a cohesive pipeline:

### **Knowledge Graph Layer (Neo4j)**
- Stores extracted entities and their relationships
- Enables complex graph queries and traversals
- Provides structured knowledge representation
- Supports relationship inference and discovery

### **Vector Search Layer (FAISS)**
- Creates dense embeddings of document chunks
- Enables semantic similarity search
- Provides fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- Handles large-scale document collections efficiently

### **Language Model Integration (LLaMA)**
- Extracts entities and relationships from text
- Generates contextually aware responses
- Processes complex queries with nuanced understanding
- Provides local, privacy-preserving inference

### **Embedding Model (SentenceTransformers)**
- Converts text to high-dimensional vectors
- Enables semantic similarity computation
- Provides multilingual support
- Optimized for sentence-level understanding

## üîç Technical Innovation

### **Intelligent Text Chunking**
```python
def chunk_text_smart(self, text: str, chunk_size: int = 800, overlap: int = 100)
```
- Sentence-aware chunking that preserves semantic coherence
- Overlapping windows to maintain context continuity
- Adaptive sizing based on document structure

### **Relationship Extraction Pipeline**
```python
def extract_relationships_with_retry(self, text: str, max_retries: int = 3)
```
- LLM-powered entity relationship extraction
- Retry logic for robust extraction
- Structured JSON output for consistent processing
- Relationship type normalization and validation

### **Hybrid Context Retrieval**
```python
def generate_answer(self, question: str, max_context_length: int = 2000)
```
- Combines semantic search results with graph traversal
- Balances vector similarity with structural relationships
- Dynamic context window management
- Multi-source evidence aggregation

### **Graph Query Optimization**
```python
def find_graph_context(self, entities: List[str], max_depth: int = 2)
```
- Efficient Cypher query generation
- Configurable traversal depth
- Entity-centric context discovery
- Relationship path analysis

## üé® Design Decisions

### **Local-First Architecture**
- All processing happens locally for privacy
- No external API dependencies for core functionality
- Offline capability for sensitive documents
- Full control over data and models

### **Modular Component Design**
- Separate concerns for different AI tasks
- Easy component swapping and upgrading
- Independent scaling of different layers
- Clean interfaces between modules

### **Error Resilience**
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Detailed debugging information
